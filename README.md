# Google-homepage
Adding a hint of lemonade to the Google.

Skills acquired during this project:

I was able to utilize the <iframe></iframe> and <div> tag to add photo at the top of the google homepage.
  Using the JSFiddle.net playground to test out the <iframe> code was welcomed alternative to VScode and Linux-notepad.
  I was able to apply the <frame> code on the Google Homepage source code, after the 1st <html> tag and before the start of the <head>.
